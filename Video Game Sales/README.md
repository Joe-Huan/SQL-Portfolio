# Video Game Sales - Analyzing the best years for video game enthusiasts from 1977 to 2020

This dataset was originally created to answer the question if video games are getting worse every year? In this project, I am more interested in answering which are the best years for video game enthusiasts? Below are some of the questions that I have thought of out of curiosity and the answers are presented in my SQL query file.

### 1) What are the top 10 best selling video games of all time?

### 2) How many games do not have any reviews from both critics and users?

### 3) How many games were released in each year?

### 4) Which video gaming platform is the most successful in terms of total copies of games shipped?

### 5) Which year with at least 10 different games released have the highest average critic review score?

### 6) According to video game critics, which year is the worse performing year?

### 7) What are the top 10 favorite years for video game enthusiasts.
